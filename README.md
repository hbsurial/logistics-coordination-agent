# Logistics Coordination Agent for Humanitarian Organizations

## Overview

The Logistics Coordination Agent is an agentic AI system designed to optimize supply chain operations for humanitarian organizations. It continuously monitors inventory levels, tracks shipments, analyzes external factors (weather, road conditions, security), and autonomously makes decisions to ensure efficient delivery of aid.

This agent helps humanitarian organizations overcome common logistics challenges:

- **Limited Resources**: Optimizes resource allocation to maximize impact
- **Unpredictable Conditions**: Adapts to changing weather, road conditions, and security situations
- **Complex Coordination**: Automates coordination between multiple warehouses and transportation systems
- **Time-Critical Deliveries**: Ensures critical supplies reach beneficiaries when needed

## Key Features

- **Real-time Inventory Monitoring**: Continuously tracks inventory levels across multiple warehouses and distribution points
- **Shipment Tracking**: Integrates with transportation APIs to monitor the status and location of all active shipments
- **Route Optimization**: Automatically calculates optimal delivery routes based on multiple factors
- **Disruption Management**: Detects and responds to supply chain disruptions by rerouting shipments
- **Demand Forecasting**: Predicts future demand based on historical data and current conditions
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Automatically notifies relevant stakeholders about important changes or decisions

## Expected Impact

- 30-40% reduction in delivery delays
- 15-25% decrease in transportation costs
- 5x faster response to changing conditions
- Near real-time visibility across the supply chain

## System Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture consisting of the following components:

1. **Core Agent**: Central decision-making module that coordinates all activities
2. **API Connectors**: Interfaces with external systems (inventory, transportation, weather)
3. **Data Processing**: Cleans and normalizes data from various sources
4. **Decision Engine**: Applies rules and algorithms to make logistics decisions
5. **Communication Module**: Handles notifications and reporting to stakeholders

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis for caching and message queuing
- Docker for containerization
- API access to inventory management system
- API access to transportation tracking system
- API access to weather and road condition services

### Data Requirements

- Inventory data (items, quantities, locations)
- Warehouse and distribution point information
- Transportation fleet details
- Historical delivery data
- Road network and infrastructure data
- Weather forecast data

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Option 1: Docker Installation (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/logistics-coordination-agent.git
   cd logistics-coordination-agent
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration settings, including API keys.

3. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app python -m agent.setup.initialize_db
   ```

5. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app python -m agent.setup.verify_installation
   ```

#### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/logistics-coordination-agent.git
   cd logistics-coordination-agent
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration settings, including API keys.

5. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   python -m agent.setup.initialize_db
   ```

6. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   python -m agent.setup.verify_installation
   ```

### Running the Agent

To start the agent:

```bash
# If using Docker
docker-compose up -d

# If installed manually
python run.py
```
